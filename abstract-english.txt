Lately, voice assistants are becoming really popular (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.), and they offer developers tools to make their own applications compatible with these systems. More specifically, in Alexa they are called "skills", and it is possible to install them just by voice. One kind of skill are news briefers, which work through RSS/Atom feeds. The main issue with them is that, for them to be compatible with Alexa, these feeds must have a very precise format, and it is very unlikely to find any that complies with it. For this reason, this project's objective is to implement a skill where you can add your favorite feeds, and listen to news articles, blogs, podcasts... through said skill. When adding a feed, you will be able to configure aspects such as its name, language (with support for english and spanish), the maximum number of news articles it should read to you, or how much text it should read at once. This configuration will be done through an app, where you will be able to manage your feeds.
